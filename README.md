# developer-portfolio

This is my portfolio website. As it stands now, this is what I will be using to advertise my skills to various companies. Github has deployed it, but the site won't connect. I have removed the custom URL and it will remain as a github.io until I can get this issue resolved. 
Hopefully, this will be enough, although I suspect it won't be.
